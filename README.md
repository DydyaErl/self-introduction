Hello everyone!

My name is Erlan, and I’m 35 years old. By education, I’m an economist, but life has always been full of surprises and new opportunities. One of my biggest hobbies is soccer or as they say in Europe - football.  Apart from that, I have a small but growing interest in video editing. It’s fascinating to see how simple clips can turn into engaging stories with the right approach.

When it comes to languages, I can say that my English is quite basic, but I’m always eager to improve. I also know a little Turkish, as I spent some time living there, and that experience broadened my horizons in many ways.

Recently, I decided to dive into the world of frontend development. It’s an incredibly exciting field, and I love the idea of creating something visually appealing and interactive with my own hands. The more I learn, the more I realize how much potential this area holds, and I can't wait to explore it further!

I joined RS School because my friends highly recommended it as a fantastic learning platform with a strong emphasis on practice. And they were absolutely right!

One of the most interesting challenges I faced during my studies was working on a Japanese crossword puzzle (Nonogram) project. The tricky part wasn't the coding itself, but rather understanding the logic behind solving these puzzles! Since I had never solved a Nonogram before, I had to turn to an unexpected source of knowledge—my father. He’s an expert at these puzzles and was more than happy to explain the rules to me. Thanks to his guidance, I was able to grasp the concept and implement the logic successfully.

Another fascinating project I worked on was outside of RS School. I was tasked with creating a full-fledged website for a professional specializing in facade insulation, decorative plaster, and painting services. One of the biggest challenges was developing a calculator that would allow users to estimate costs based on several parameters. But the most exciting part? The customer requested a feature where the image inside the calculator dynamically changes color depending on the selected facade color. Thanks to the materials I recently studied about the Canvas API, I was able to implement this functionality, and it was a truly rewarding experience.

Overall, my learning journey has been full of challenges and discoveries. Every new task pushes me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to think creatively and find solutions. At first, I hesitated—was it worth starting something completely new at my age? But now, despite all the difficulties, I’m confident that I made the right choice. Learning something new not only expands my professional skills but also makes me a better and stronger person.

So, let’s keep moving forward, embracing every challenge along the way. Thank you for listening, and I wish you all a good day and productive work ahead!
